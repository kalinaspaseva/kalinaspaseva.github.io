        <h1>Hi there, <br/> I'm Kalina!</h1>
        <p>I am a 19-years-old computer science student at <br/> Faculty of computer science and engineering <br/>in Skopje,
            Macedonia with a huge love for <br/>coding, as well as fashion,dancing and travelling!<br/><br/> In
            my free time you can find me at the gym or hanging<br/> out with my friends. In the weekends I like to treat <br/>myself, so
             I particularly enjoy watching Netflix, reading a<br/> good book or making a nice dessert to cleanse my mind.<br/><br/>
            I am exceptionally interested in front end development, as it <br/> allows me to use programming for artistic expression,which
            is<br/> the perfect career choice for me!<br/>

        <p>One of my hobbies that plays a really big part in my life is Folk dancing!
        A folk dance is a dance that reflects the life of the people of a certain country or region and almost every
            young kid in my country goes to folk dancing classes at least a year in their lives.However only for a few of us
        folk dancing becomes a part of our lifestyle and for me, it was a part of my life for 8 years!</p>
        <p>It is sure an experience of a lifetime, considering the number of countries I have visited during these 8 years,
        as well as the friends i have made from all around the world and the many things I have learnt about the cultures
        of the European and Asian countries i have come in contact with. It's such a lovely experience and I don't think anything
        can replace those moments I have spent with these people.</p>

        <p>Ever since I was a little girl I loved helping my mother around the kitchen
        when she was cooking and especially baking. Is there anything better than having a house that smells like
        baking chocolate chips? I love it because it's a great way to relax after a hard day and it allows
        you to be creative and inovative. It's definitely one of the best hobbies anyone can have, considering the end result of
        this little activity:)</p>
